      <p class="card-text">Arguably, one of the first bands I ever got into. When I was about 11/12, I heard their song "The Adventures Of Rain Dance Maggie" from their album <em>I'm With You</em> I was hooked once I heard Flea's simple sounding, yet catchy bass line that compliments Chad Smith's drumming, the rest of the music, coming from frontman Anthony Kiedis and ex-guitarist Josh Klinghoffer all culminated into a song that is easy to get into.<br><br>
        From there and the years after listening to this song, I went as far back from their album <em>Blood Sugar Sex Magik</em> during John Frusciante's first tenure in the band. Though, in my honest opinion, while I do enjoy a lot of Frusciante's input on the band, I really enjoy <em>I'm With You</em> and <em>The Getaway</em> the most, as it does have a lot of my favorite songs from them.<br>
      <br>On a side note that goes along with this, I went to see them live in 2022 in East Rutherford at the MetLife Stadium. While i loved their performance, to be honest, I doubt I'll ever go to another stadium concert, way too much traffic and people lol. </p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Weezer</h5>
      <p class="card-text">An important band in my adolescence, Weezer has managed to fit many of the emotions that I've felt during those years. Although some albums are duds, looking at you <em>Make Believe</em> and <em>Raditude</em>, most of their catalogue I still would listen to from time to time. Personally their best records to me would be <em>The White Album</em> and <em>Everything Will Be Alright In The End</em>.
        If I recall correctly, one of the first songs from them that I did get hooked on was "Back to the Shack", where after a couple of duds, frontman Rivers Cuomo sings about bringing their older style back, Brian Bell playing a great solo, Scott Shriner keeping the bass line simple and catchy, and Patrick Wilson keeping the rhythm.
      <br><br> This is another band that I also saw live around 2016, and that is the first ever concert I've ever been to and it was such an amazing experience seeing one of my favorite bands live.</p>
      <h5>Favorite Songs (In no particular order):</h5>

      <h5 class="card-title">Bloc Party</h5>
      <p class="card-text">One of the other bands that I got into early on, all thanks to Guitar Hero. In Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock, they included the song Helicopter from their album <em>Silent Alarm</em>, and I was hooked instantly by how bombastic former drummer Matt Tong is on the kit. The synchronised playing by Kele Okereke and Russel Lissack, and the great bass line by former bassist Gordon Moakes.
        While throughout their time, some of their albums can be divisive, such as <em>Intimacy</em> and <em>Hymns</em>, there are still songs to be enjoyed on either album. Although my personal favorites are <em>Four</em>, with how experimental they got with some of their songs like "Octopus" and "Truth", and <em>A Weekend In The City</em> having some of their earlier experiments with "Hunting For Witches" and "Waiting for the 7.18".
      <br><br>Also, I'm exited to go see them live in May (at least as of typing this out). </p>
      <h5>Favorite Songs (In no particular order):</h5>

        <li>Traps</li>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Good Kid</h5>
      <p class="card-text">One of the latest bands that I have gotten into, Good Kid brings a nice indie sound that has slowly, but surely became a bit mnore popular, thanks to the band not only making their music DMCA-free, so that content creators can use their music, their music has also been included in the game <em>Fortnite</em>
      With voclaist Nick Frosst having a good voice that fits with the genre perfectly, drummer Jon Kereliuk, while keeping it simple, bring a good fast-paced rhythm, bassest Michael Kozakov giving great perfomances, and guitarists David Wood and Jacob Tsafatinos know how to make a great and catchy melody to each song.
        <br><br>Unfortunatly, they haven't released a full album just yet, their discography only consists of EPs and one video game sountrack. Regardless, I would say my favorite EP from them would be their latest one, <em>Good Kid 3</em>, with <em>Good Kid2</em> containing what I think to be my favorite song from them, "Drifting".</p>
      <br>Since they're a band that is starting to gain more and more popularity, I know that eventually, I will be able to see them live.

      <p class="card-text">Another such important band in my life, beginning with the song "Pray Tell", still being one of my favorite songs from them. I discovered them after they had disbanded in 2014, while at first I was a bit sad to hear that they broke up, it really gave me a chance to really explore their earlier catalog.
        The vocals from Stephen Christian are always a joy to the ears, the amazing drum work from Nathan Young, groovy bass lines from Deon Rexroat, and the great guitar work from both Joeseph Milligan and Christian McAlhaney. Recently however, the band got back together and released new music after 8 years in the short, yet sweet <em>Silverline</em>.
        <br><br>If we're counting EPs, then while it is a bit of recency bias, <em>Silverline</em> would be my favorite but of music from them, otherwise, <em>Lowborn</em>, their last full-length album wouold be my favorite from them.
      <br><br>I've also seen them live, and it was fantastic, currently, im anticipating a full-length release sometime in the future.</p>

      <p class="card-text">While not a band that is extremely important to how it shaped my life, it is a band that I can consistently come back to. With a plethora of their songs that I listen to till this day. Their song "Panic Switch" is what initially got me into the band, with how catchy the bass line is from Nikki Monninger, how unique Brian Aubert's vocals are as well as how great his riffs are, and how proficient Chris Guanlao is on the drums.
        <br><br>One of my favorite albums from them is <em>Widow's Weeds</em>, with a close second being their most recent album <em>Physical Thrills</em>. Overall, a great band that I hope to see live someday, alongside the others that I want to see live.</p>
