<h1>My Favorite Video Games</h1>
<div class="card-deck">
  <div class="card">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="images/sa1.png" alt="Sonic Adventure">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Sonic Adventure</h5>
      <p class="card-text">While I never played the original that came out on the Sega Dreamcast, I played the DX version on the Nintendo Gamecube. To this day, i still go back to it from time to time, because to me, this was a very enjoyable game.
      While I do see the issues it has had, and I see how it hasn't aged that well, it still holds a place in my heart for it being one of the first games I have ever played. </p>

  <div class="card">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="images/yakuza.png" alt="Yakuza 0">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Yakuza 0</h5>
      <p class="card-text">One of the more recent games here, it is one that i have gotten hooked to and while I haven't reached the newest game in the series, I can't wait to go through all the stories and see where and how the series got to where it is currently.
      It is a great introduction to the series, giving the player a few characters that become more notable in the later games, and how the main characters became the way they are.</p>

  <div class="card">
    <img class="card-img-top" src="images/GH3.png" alt="Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock">
    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Guitar Hero 3: Legends of Rock</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The game that has essentially shaped my music taste and has inspired me to pick up a real guitar. This game had plenty of songs that have stuck with me through my teenage years and some I still listen to, to this day.
      From bands like Bloc Party, Slipknot, Queens of the Stone Age, and more. There are plenty of rock and metal songs, from the classics till around 2009, there's a lot to enjoy.</p>

<div class="card-deck">
<div class="card">
  <img class="card-img-top" src="images/doom.png" alt="DOOM">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Doom (All of them)</h5>
    <p class="card-text">In this, I will mention all the Doom games, from the original Doom all the way to Doom Eternal. Starting off with the original Doom, it was a fun and fast-paced FPS that felt challenging as it went on.
      The ones i remember the most would be the 2016 reboot and Eternal, where while it did put Doom in the more typical FPS controls, it still felt like an evolution because it still keeps what made the old games fun.</p>

<div class="card">
  <img class="card-img-top" src="images/poke.png" alt="Pokemon Ultra Sun">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Pokemon Ultra Sun</h5>
    <p class="card-text">One of the more recent Pokemon games, it is one that introduced me to the proper mainline Pokemon games, where the first Pokemon related game I've ever played it Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team on the Gameboy Advance.
    While online discourse is conflicted on the state of the recent games, I still feel positive to the game being my intro to the world of Pokemon.</p>

<div class="card">
  <img class="card-img-top" src="images/sms.png" alt="Super Mario Sunshine">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Super Mario Sunshine</h5>
    <p class="card-text">The first Super Mario game that I have ever played. As a young kid, this game really took up a good chunk of my childhood to beat, despite not beating it until recently. Even playing some of the more recent games such as Odyssey, I still feel like it doesn't quite match up to what first got me into the series.
    The only closest that really filled me with pure joy and bliss would be the Galaxy games.</p>
